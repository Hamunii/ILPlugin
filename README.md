# ILPlugin: A Simple BepInEx Plugin written in IL

This is simple Lethal Company mod written in IL. All it does is print stuff into the BepInEx console, like when it's loaded, and in one Hook at the very start of the game.

### Why?

Writing a BepInEx Plugin in IL is a good way to learn about IL. It can also be helpful when writing transpilers/ILHooks.

If you want to play with this yourself, I'd recommend creating a reference plugin in C# to figure out how to do things.
